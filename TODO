# To Do List

## - Create a reliable way for the user to select a file and play it.
      This process is the back bone of the program, and it is very important this step is completed. The user should be able to note only choose an audio file to
      play, but must also be able to listen to it without any major issues.
      
## - Create a song object.
      A song object will be important for the playlist functions. A song will have three variables, title, length, and artist. All three are strings, title will be 
      the title of the song, length will be how long the song is, and artist will be the performer or perfomers of the song.
      
## - Create a playlist object.
      Playlist object will have two variables, title and track_list. The title variable will be a string, and this will just be the name given to the playlist.
      The track_list variable will be a list of song objects.
