# Program Description

The program will be a terminal based mp3 player. The program will function as any mp3, allowing users to listen to their local audio files via its interface. Aside from the basic function of playing audio files, users will also have access to features seen in many modern music players, such as creating, viewing and editing playlists, browsing for local audio files via the program interface, and skipping, pausing and playing tracks. Users should be able to have a complete music player experience, without the need of a graphical user interface.
